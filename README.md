# promptface
custom deepface(v0.0.91) fork repo

## How to use

You can use the promptface by running main.py , because it's basically taking the deepface.modules.streaming.analysis method out as the main.

There is an example of a database folder format that was modified a little from Deepface Streaming.

```
root
├──main.py
├──Logs
│   ├── promptface.log
├── ImgDataBase
│   ├── Alice
│   │   ├── Alice01.jpg
│   │   ├── Alice02.jpg
│   ├── Bob
│   │   ├── Bob01.jpg
```

Some logic has been changed
- The cosine_distance measurement method has been changed to use scikit-learn.
- Sort df in identity order.
